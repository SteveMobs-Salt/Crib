 ## About
 
Have you ever wished you had one app that could organise your household? 

Crib sets out to simplify the way you budget, record and keep track of your expenses and add items to your shopping list on the go. Many of us are sharing a household or are often making plans with friends and family and want a way to make it simple to plan together. With Crib you can make as many groups as you like in which members share budgets, expenses, and lists. If you happen to be the one that picks up the tab on your night out or does the group's shopping, you can simply split the expense between group members who will be notified about how much they need to pay you. 

### Core features

#### Shopping list

Each user has their own shopping list while household groups have access to the same shopping list.

#### Budget

Set up a budget for the household with main expenses eg. groceries, rent etc.
When an item is purchased/service paid for, it is added to the expenses feature under a certain category then it is automatically deducted from that part of the budget (for example 100 Eur spent on groceries will be deducted from the total budget of 500 Eur for the monthly groceries).

#### Split expenses

If a member of the household purchases an item they can add the expense under their name and it automatically sends a notification to the other members of how much they owe that person for the joint purchase.
Individuals can send reminders to other members of the household to settle up what they owe each other. 

__Note__: This app was built as part of a two-week project and it's a work in progress.
Additional features will be added.
